I changed the sample to use the Nuget package instead of the project.

If you deploy this, I am working on including this inside the Nuget package, 
but for now I had to add the following css to site.css:

.customupload
{
    display: inline-block;
    visibility: visible;
}
.customupload input[type=file]
{
    visibility: hidden;
    display: none;
}

And in the .razor component, I added the customupload class to the div surrounding the FileUpload:

<div class="customupload">
    <FileUpload CustomSuccessMessage="Your file uploaded successfully." OnChange="OnFileUploaded"
        ShowStatus="false"  PartialGuidLength="10" MaxFileSize="4194304" FilterByExtension="true" 
        ShowCustomButton="true" ButtonText="Select File" ButtonClassName="buttonwide"        
        AllowedExtensions=".jpg;.png;" ShowResetButton="true" OnReset="OnReset" 
        CustomExtensionMessage="Only .jpg and .png files are allowed." AppendPartialGuid="true"                
        FileTooLargeMessage="The file uploaded must be 4 megabytes or smaller.">
    </FileUpload>
</div>

I am trying to embed more of the behavior in the component, but this works for now.
